# service-discovery-pcf
    This is tested code on Pivotal cloud foundry for Eureka discovery.
    This sample can be modified  according to your PCF  configuration and can be deployed  which will
    help you in querying your built microservices by your service/Microservice name not by your 
    mapped route of your service on PCF. This will help in achieving  resilient application 
    
    This code is not for running on local host but for multiple host/server 
    
    Also Please note that you need to open firewall by using unstructured  external dependency service from PCF
